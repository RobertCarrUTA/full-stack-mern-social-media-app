# Reasons for using "npm install body-parser cors express mongoose nodemon" on the server
* [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser): enables us to send post requests
* [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors): enables cross-origin requests
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): used as a framework for creating the routing of this application
* [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose): we use mongoose to create models for our posts
* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon): we use nodemon so we don't have to manually reset the server every time we make a change (nodemon will do this for us)
